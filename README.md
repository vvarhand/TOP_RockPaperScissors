# TOP_RockPaperScissors
The Odin Project RPS Game 

## Objective:

1. Get first-hand experience with DOM-elements manipulation using JS. [Completed]
2. Train JS skills.
3. Improve CSS skills. [Completed]

## Notes:

Overall, I feel way more confident about my ability to use code to implement ideas.

A lot more time needs to be spent at the beginning of the project, specifically in the UI/UX Design stage,
as I have spent a few hours rewriting UI code alone.

Do Mobile-first development!

Better understood the JS *Event Loop* and *async/await*. (resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3tm0quoqE)

## Potential upgrades:

I have not tested load times and optimizations. Potential to return to see how little, hypothetically, this app can weigh :D.
Can FP be applied somewhere in the code?
Hint: use DevTools.

## Next:

Moving on to Etch-a-Sketch, then doing a few projects using Back-end Frameworks and React.
